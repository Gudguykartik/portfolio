Developed a machine learning model to classify disaster-related tweets. Performed exploratory data analysis, implemented text preprocessing, and utilized GloVe embeddings. Built and trained an LSTM neural network using Keras. The project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, NLP techniques, and deep learning.

The objective of this project is to analyze the 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users and predict which previously purchased item will be in user's next order. Customer segmentation and affinity analysis are also done to study user purchase patterns.

A hybrid-filtering personalized news articles recommendation system which can suggest articles from popular news service providers based on reading history of twitter users who share similar interests (Collaborative filtering) and content similarity of the article and userâ€™s tweets (Content-based filtering).

In this project I have used models such as RNN, LSTM, 1D-CNN to predict the engine failure 50 cycles ahead of its time, and calculated feature importance from them using sensitivity analysis and shap values. Exponential degradation and similarity-based models are also used to calculate its remaining life.

In this project, I have employed regression techniques to estimate the Power curve of an on-shore Wind turbine. Nonlinear trees based regression methods perform best as true power curve is nonlinear. XGBoost is implemented and optimized using GridSearchCV which yields lowest Test RMSE-6.404.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/phase1.jpg"> **[Multivariate Phase 1 Analysis](https://github.com/archd3sai/Multivariate-Phase-1-Analysis)** 

Objective of this project is to identify the in-control data points and eliminate out of control data points to set up distribution parameters for manufacturing process monitoring. I utilized PCA for dimension reduction and Hotelling T2 and m-CUSUM control charts to established mean and variance matrices.

Objective of this project is to perform predictive assesment on the GDP of India through an inferential analysis of various socio-economic factors. Various models are compared and Stepwise Regression model is implemented which resulted in 5.7% Test MSE.

In this project I applied various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and LightGBM to detect consumers who will default the loan. SMOTE is used to combat class imbalance and LightGBM is implemented that resulted into the highest accuracy 98.89% and 0.99 F1 Score.
